Flag Me enables you to add a country flag before the title of your posts or pages.

== Description ==

Since I started my personal blog, I began to wonder what would be the right way to internationalize it. Some people opt to create a dedicated site for each language and some people develop more sophisticated solutions. I made something quite simple: *Flag Me*. 

[Flag Me](http://www.fahien.me/flag-me) is a *Wordpress Plugin* which enables you to add a country flag before the title of your posts or pages in the sidebar. This makes it easier for visitors to understand the language in which it is written content.

> If you like the plugin, feel free to support my work [donating via PayPal](http://www.fahien.me/donate).

== Installation ==

1. Upload the whole directory **flag-me** to the **/wp-content/plugins/** directory;
2. Activate the plugin through the *Plugins* menu in WordPress;
3. Edit your post and pick a language from the *Language Box*.
